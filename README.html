<p>I created this repository as a starter to my projects.</p>
<p>If you find it useful you may download this for your projects. Please keep in mind that this is a live repository and things may change without warning.</p>
<p>My main development tool is Dreamweaver. The problem that I am having with Dreamweaver is two-fold, namely</p>
<ol>
<li>the Sass compiler also compiles partials after these have been saved (known bug)</li>
<li>there is no facility to concatenate and minify (uglify) Javascript files (request submitted)</li>
</ol>
<p>To overcome these problems, I use Prepros for my workflow. </p>
<p>There is a universal problem with uglify.js in that it does not understand ES6, therefore I have not attempted to compile the JS source files. Instead, I have used the available CDN files</p>
<p>Have fun.</p>
