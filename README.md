# Bootstrap-4-template

I created this repository as a starter to my projects.

If you find it useful you may download this for your projects. Please keep in mind that this is a live repository and things may change without warning.

My main development tool is Dreamweaver. The problem that I am having with Dreamweaver is two-fold, namely
1. the Sass compiler also compiles partials after these have been saved (known bug. Edit: Fixed in build 10100)
2. there is no facility to concatenate and minify (uglify) Javascript files (request submitted)

To overcome these problems, I use Prepros for my workflow. 

There is a universal problem with uglify.js in that it does not understand ES6, therefore I have not attempted to compile the JS source files. Instead, I have used the available CDN files

Have fun.
